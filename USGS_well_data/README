Run scripts:
	1. run 'well_data_*.py' -> output well maps and well trend/resid data
	2. run 'calc_basin.py' -> average over each basin
	3. run 'rewrite.scr' -> write asc map files
	4. run 'plot_basin_trend_sd.py' (change ouput figure name)



ori_data_from_Liz (dir)
	original well data from Liz and Sayma (/nfs/hydro6/usr1/eclark/OTHER_WORK/GRACE_trend/USGS_well_data)
	field measurement

daily_data_climNet
	daily data for sites in Climate Response Network
	[agency] [siteID] [date] [water level (ft)] [data status] [water level type; 0 for feet below land surface; 1 for feet above a datum]
	water level might be daily mean level below surface, max level below surfac, or level above a datum; but the data type is consistent for each site
	data status:
		 A  Approved for publication -- Processing and review completed
		 P  Provisional data subject to revision
		 e  Value has been estimated
		the status will appear as A; P; A:e; P:e; A:> (not sure what last one means)

site info (dir)
	all_sites_info (dir)
		info of all sites; many of them don't have data available
		in csv format
	siteID_count_have_data (dir)
		a list of sites that have available data
		[siteID] [number of available data]
	site_info_fld_have_data (dir)

		in csv format
		Site identification number,Decimal latitude,Decimal longitude,Altitude of Gage/land surface [ft],Local aquifer type code,Field water-level measurements count
	site_num_climNet_allSites
		a list of site numbers in Climate Response Network
		some of the listed sites might be outside of Eastern U.S. region
	all_sites_info_v2 (dir)
		download sites info for all field measurement again;
		include national aquifer code and well depth;
		the sites might be different than those in 'all_sites_info' dir; not sure why
	site_info_fld_have_data_v2 (dir)
		the same sites as 'site_info_fld_have_data' dir
		in csv format
		Site identification number,Decimal latitude,Decimal longitude,Altitude of Gage/land surface,Local aquifer type code,National aquifer code,Well depth,Field water-level measurements count
