well_data_fld_measure.py
	process field measurement data
	data process:
		1. for each site, make sure that the type of water level data is consistent (i.e., either all are 'depth under land surface' or all are 'water level relative to a datum'). If not consistent, using the height of land surface at the site (this information is in site info file) to convert them to the same type
		2. if for an observation, either of its [water level data]/[measuring date] is missing or invalid, we think this observation is invalid; if for a site, there is no valid observation, discard this site
		3. if the lat/lon information at a site is missing, discard this site
		4. if a certain observation has a status code (e.g., pumping, damage, etc.), discard the whole site
	data selection and filtering:
		1. select the first data in each time segment (e.g., in each month); if there is no data in this segment, skip this segment
		2. check uniformity - for the selected data at each site, if there is a certain-window-continious missing data (e.g., 2-year window), discard this site
	Sy
		1. Sy is estimated from the three digits in National Aquifer Code (6 types altogether). If National Aquifer Code is missing for a site, Sy is estimated as 0.1

well_data_daily_measure.py
	process daily data
	data process:
		1. if the lat/lon information at a site is missing, discard this site
	data selection and filtering:
		1. select the first data in each time segment (e.g., in each month); if there is no data in this segment, skip this segment
		2. check uniformity - for the selected data at each site, if there is a certain-window-continious missing data (e.g., 2-year window), discard this site
